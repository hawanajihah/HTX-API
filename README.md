# HTX-API

## Project Overview
This API is designed to automatically process uploaded images, generate thumbnails, extract metadata, and provide AI-generated captions using the Salesforce BLIP Image Captioning Model. The API is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy, with images stored in an SQLite database.

Unfortunately, I am really bad at this and my computer storage space was inevitably too small for the AI to process.
